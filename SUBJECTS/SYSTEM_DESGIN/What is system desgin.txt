System desgin is the process of defining the arhitecture, compoenetes, modules , interfaces and data for a sytem to satisfy specified requirements.

invvoles translating user requirementes into a detailed blueprint.
that guides the implementation phase.


the goals is to create a well-organized and efficient structure that meets
teh intendeded purpose while considering factors like scaliblity , maintainablity 
and performance. 

step 1 : 
    planning 
step 2 : 
    Feasibility Study
step 3 :
    System Desgin 
step 4 :
    implementation
step 5 :
    Testing
step 6 :
    Deployment
step 7 :
    Maintenacne and support 

Objectives of System Desgin
    1. practicality : system that should target teh set of audiences 
    2. accuracy : it should fullfill all the requiremntes around which it is 
        dessgined functional or non functional requriments.
    3. Completness : should meet all the user reqruimetn ( user side ) ( not the dsegin side) 
    4. Efficient: should utilize the resources avoidign waste that 
    inc cost and preventing underuse which can slow down pefoemcne 
    and inc latency 
    5. Reliality :
