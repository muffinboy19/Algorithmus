basic information and defination said by kunal kushwa on oops

 /*
  * This video is going to be about packages


  what is package and why dowe use package
  are containesr for classees / boxes for clsses


  basically package is just a folder
  in a package there can not be 2 classes of the same name

  now the concern that the name might colide with some different class
  is now gone


  listen we use the import to acess  differnte files in a difff package
  also we are able to see only those files which are declared as public here

  example
  static import  com.package_name.a.function_name

  java starts looking first in teh current directory





  * static
   in the same package you do not have to import the class
   those properites that are object independte that would common among all objects

   so bascially it is a such a proerty that you declare static would have a comon
   value among all of its object
   you inc the value in one / dec in other
   it value will be same acrss  all the class instances



   and while such proerpties inside a construter are not written as

   this .stic_prperty

   they are written with the clss name
  works 2with both of them
  rason bcz fisrt it iwill search for teh this.varible but if it does not find it
  then it will sarch for the clawss.name varible hence this is workign




  defination :
  When the meber is declared static it can be accesed before any of the
  object of the class , and without begin refferenced
  even if we do not create any class
  we can still access this member


  even funcitons can also be declared as static
  best cample would be
  public static vvoid main

  reason : we can use this thing without creating
  the object of the Main Class

  thus code we have to create a object of aclass to run it
  but here we are doing it without creating a  ojbect

  inside the static method we cannot use any non static calls
  a staict method can only acess static data as
  every non static data is bascically belogning to an object

  if we declare a static function inside the class we will not be able to use
  this keyword inside the class,  as the funtion is now object indepedent thus this holds now value anymore

  do not forget to leanr also the internal implemenation
  of the constructor calling

do not forget to learn the whole static
function
