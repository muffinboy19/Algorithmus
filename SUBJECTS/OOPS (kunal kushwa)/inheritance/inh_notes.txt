Here we are going to learn about the
types of inheritance


1. single inheritance ( one class extends another class)
2. Multilevl inheritance ( one class cna inherit a class and the the class cna
have a child too )
        parent
        child1
        child2

bottom class has teh idea  of al lthe above class

3. Multiple inheritance
one class extends to more than one classes

so exmple c has 2 parents class  a and b


C obj = new C();
c.n // if n uis cmmon toi both the parent

sol : this is not suppoted in java
hint : thus this implemented using interface

/// interfacxe is a sprate topic


4 . hierachial inhertiace
one class is inheritaeed by many classes
