/*(
here we would write the code for a minum spaning tree
definaiton of spanning tree: 
were we have n nodes n-1 edges
and all nodes are reacble from each other 
    - is undirected ( here at least)


    ok so what i get it that 
    there would exits a graph  n we would draw a spaning tree of it 
    and the spanning tree which would have the minum weight sum  total of all edges 
    is called the mininum spanning tree


    we can find a mst from
        prunes algo 
        krunles algo( using disjonint sets).
