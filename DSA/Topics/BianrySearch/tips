calling a function create more time commpl3xity doing it there itslef if less time compelx 


specifyhin the thing in the else if case is more fast then jsut addign them to hte 
the major else brackeet 


example 



else{

    if(1)

    if(2)



}

this was slower than 

else if(1){

}

else{


}


3. instead of declaring the int mid everyting delcare it once in for all at the top this increase a lot of speed
