to identify that this is a 1-D dp problem look for words like 
count the number of ways or find the minum or maximum or best way 


or the conecpt of try all the possiblites then u must use 
dp

some tips for recursion : 
try to represent the problems in term of index 

do all possibles stuff on the index according to the pro9blem statment 


some classic examples : 
sum of stuff ==> count all ways 
min( of all stuf)==> find the min

stringstream ss(s);

used to extracts words from line input 
easily does that just do 
string temp="";
while(ss >> temp){
    take the wods whreed you want 

    wit htemp ;
}
